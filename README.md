## What's inside this repository?

1. `README.md`: A markdown file that explains the content of the repository.
2. `adm_hw2.ipynb`: A [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/msancor/ADM-HW2/blob/main/adm_hw2.ipynb) file containing all the relevant exercises and reports belonging to the *Research Questions*, the *Command Line Question*, the *AWS Question* and the *Algorithmic Question*.
3. ``modules/``: A folder including two Python modules used to solve the exercises in `adm_hw2.ipynb`. These files included are:
    - `__init__.py`: A *init* file that allows us to import the modules into our Jupyter Notebook.

4. ``scripts/``: A folder including two Python scripts used to solve the *Algorithmic Question* and *AWS Question* and two bash scripts used to solve the *Command Line Question*. The files included are:
    - `algorithmic_question.py`: A Python script including the code to solve the *Algorithmic Question*.
    - `aws_question.py`: A Python script including the code to solve the *AWS Question*.
    - `commandline_original.sh`: A bash script including the code to solve the *Command Line Question*.
    - `commandline_LLM.sh`: A bash script including the code to solve the *Command Line Question* created by ChatGPT.
5. ``.gitignore``: A predetermined `.gitignore` file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a Python project.
